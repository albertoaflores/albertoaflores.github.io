A few months ago, I was invited to speak on Spring Boot and Cloud Native. This was a good discussion. It was fun to build an app from scratch using Boot. For those interested, you can find the app in my github account:<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/albertoaflores/spring-boot-demo">https://github.com/albertoaflores/spring-boot-demo</a><br /><br />Slides used for that preso can be found here:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/albertoaflores/spring-boot-intro">http://www.slideshare.net/albertoaflores/spring-boot-intro</a><br /><br />Hope some find this useful.
