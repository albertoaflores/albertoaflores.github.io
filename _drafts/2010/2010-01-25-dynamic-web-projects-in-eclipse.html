As I fixed a maven war project to more effectively use the <span style="font-family: inherit;">Web Tools Project </span>(WTP), I realized I could share the configuration I used with the hope to help others get some light as needed.&nbsp; I'll be assuming you are familiar with the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">.classpath</span> file as well as the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">.project</span> file (which Eclipse uses heavily) to setup the dynamic web project.&nbsp; Furthermore, I'll assume you are familiar with the notion of a "<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">nature</span>" within the Eclipse environment.&nbsp; Lastly, I would like to refer readers to the official Eclipse <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/The_Official_Eclipse_FAQs">FAQ</a>.&nbsp; In particular, I would like to refer you to the section where the sharing of the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_What_is_the_advantage_of_sharing_the_project_file_in_a_repository%3F">.project</a> and .<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_set_up_a_Java_project_to_share_in_a_repository%3F">classpath</a> files in version control (e.g. subversion, git, etc) is considered a good practice. Note that these tips will also work with the Springsource Tool Suite (STS)<br /><a name='more'></a><br />The first thing you need to worry about is to make sure you have all bundles installed from the Java Enterprise Update Site.&nbsp; Notice that this is different that the standard Eclipse distribution. If you successfully installed it, you should have the ability to create a new "<i>Dynamic Web Project</i>" from the new Project menu. Once that is in place and you created a new "<i>Dynamic Web Project</i>" take a look at the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">.classpath</span> file. It has some entries of type "<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">classpathentry</span>". It should look something like:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2923847.js?file=.classpath.xml"></script><br />The kind of <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">classpathentry</span> "<i>con</i>" means "<i>classpath container</i>". It's the way <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">WTP</span> will resolve classpath entries as you deploy your <i>Dynamic Web Project </i>via Eclipse. Now, take a look at your .<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">project</span> file. It should look something like:<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2923886.js?file=project.xml"></script><br />There could be other <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">buildcommand</span> entries or other <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">nature</span> entries, however these are very important to have in order to enable all tooling support for a <i>"Dynamic Web Project"</i>. Now, the one file that has some more information is found within the <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">.settings</span> folder. This file is named <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">org.eclipse.wst.common.component</span>. This file is very interesting. It shows how Eclipse (or STS) will deploy the project to the Server of your choice (e.g. Tomcat).  It should look something like:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2923892.js?file=org.eclipse.wst.common.component.xml"></script><br />&nbsp;Hopefully, this file speaks for itself (as far as to understand how <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">WTP</span> deploys this project as an "exploded" war).&nbsp; Notice that I'm using a traditional maven directory structure for defining a webapp. As these files are in place, you should be able to execute the "<i>Run In Server</i>" command (from the <i>"Run"</i> menu) and, assuming you have a server configured, you should be able to see your web application running via Eclipse. Of course, this means you could not only "<i>Run</i>" but also "<i>Debug</i>" whereby all your breakpoints and other debugging tools would work seemlessly.
