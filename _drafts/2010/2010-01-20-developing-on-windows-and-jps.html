&nbsp; In the last few months, I have been forced to develop using a Windows environment. I must admit I miss most of my linux/unix command prompt usage, among which is the "<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">jps</span>" tool.&nbsp; For those of you not familiar with it, <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">jps</span> is a "process status" tool and is part of the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">jdk</span>.&nbsp;  According to the documentation, this is an unsupported tool and comes with no guarantee, however I've found it to be a simple tool that can come in handy in certain situations as the one I'm about to describe.<br /><br />&nbsp; During my initial <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">maven</span> build, the test phase was throwing exceptions due an incorrect configuration.&nbsp; As I tried to delete the target directory, windows reported the folder was in use.&nbsp; Cygwin's "<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">ps</span>" command didn't reveal much.&nbsp; Window's "Task Manager" wasn't really saying much either.&nbsp; This is where "<span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">jps</span>" brought light.&nbsp; <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Jps</span> reported the SurefireBoot.jar still hanging in there (apparently due to some unrelease resource). Unfortunately, the problem became even more serious as the reported PID was not that simple to <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">kill</span> (using Cygwin's <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">kill</span> command).<br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />&nbsp; As I researched some more on this, I came accross the following <a href="https://visualvm.dev.java.net/troubleshooting.html">post</a> where the issue of the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">TMP</span> environment variable fixed some problems. As soon as I did this (setting the environment variable), I was able to resolve my problem (in my case, it was an issue with proper security in the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">TMP</span> folder and its subfolders). This was not a "<i>show-stopper",</i> but certainly a nice to know as this <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">TMP</span> folder is not only used with <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">jps</span>, but also with <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">jvisualvm</span>, another nice free tool from the <span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">jdk</span>.
