As I tried to introduce powerful animations to personal RIA project, I came across this project called <a href="http://www.efflex.org/">Efflex</a>. The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.efflex.org/EfflexExplorer.html">demos</a>&nbsp;showed a lot of potential. I was very impressed with some of the nice features to improve <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">ViewStack</span> selection (particularly the Flip3D and Cube3D demos). As my excitement drove me to use it, I found so many problems integrating to it, particularly with the following:<br /><ol><li>There were no SWC files to use (the 2 provided never worked).&nbsp;</li><li>Building the source required FlexBuilder as well as to understand the project layout.</li><li>Some of the code was not committed, hence the compilation failed in so many ways.</li><li>There were dependencies that were not documented.</li></ol><div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div>I took this as a personal challenge and I can happily report that I made it work. I'd like to describe what I had to do to make it happen in case others go through this problem (as I suspect it's the case based on some of the postings I read on the site).<br /><a name='more'></a>As of the writing of this entry, all what I'm about to describe remains true. I have found some postings with instructions for a old revision of the efflex project. Things have changed a bit, particularly with flex4 and Fb4 (now out). For the purposes of this writing, it's important to point out that all these problems occurred in trying to use the&nbsp;<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">CubeAway3<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Times;">&nbsp;effect.</span></span><br /><br /><b>Attempt 1</b>: I tried the obvious: using the SWC files found on their site. Of course, this didn't work at first. &nbsp;I was trying to use the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">CubeAway3D</span> effect. &nbsp;Fb3 kept on reporting compilation errors (primarily on a missing type). &nbsp;As Tink (the author of the library) suggested to use the source code and build it yourself (post found in the <i>efflex</i> site), I tried checking out the source code and importing it into Fb3.<br /><br /><b>Attempt 2</b>: The import was somewhat troublesome as the source code (from svn) was not complete. I mean, there were missing classes (apparently never committed). Also, I found some classes that required some dependencies that were not documented anywhere. These were <i>away3d</i>, <i>papervision3d</i> and <i>tink</i> (the last one was simply a utility project).<br /><br /><b>Attempt 3</b>: I imported the source code of <i>away3d</i>. This didn't take much time to fix, other than to ensure that I was compiling for flash player 10. Once that was fixed, I generated a SWC. &nbsp;Success!<br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"></div></div><br /><b>Attempt 4</b>: I imported the source code of <i>papervision3d</i>. &nbsp;Luckily this didn't cause much problem either. It was pretty straight forwar, however any documentation on this would have helped (in lieu of a SWC).<br /><br /><b>Attempt 5</b>: I checked out the source code for <i>tink</i>. This was apparently another utility project developed by the author of <i>efflex</i>. &nbsp;Fine, I accepted his philosophy, so I moved on. Luckily it compiled fine.<br /><br />After doing all these, I decided to remove the non compiling classes (from the <i>efflex</i> project). I decided that as I checked this out from svn, I can recover them later (when their needed classes are committed). This helped compile and generate a SWC file which I was now able to use. &nbsp;As I tried it, my <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">CubeAway3D</span> effect worked like a charm. It was very rewarding to see my ViewStack more vividly, nonetheless, I think we need to evaluate better how we can improve some of these projects.<br /><br /><div></div>
