excerpt: When we talk about User stories, we often assume that everyone will quickly write 'As a user A, I want to do X so that I can do'. Anyone who practices agiles in some fashion knows that finding those stories takes effort. Historically, this is not any different than gathering requirements. Vertical Slicing is a technique that can help focus on the discovery of requirements while always deliverying value.

Here is a great definition of the MVP:

> "A minimum viable product (MVP) helps entrepreneurs start the process of learning as quickly as possible. It is not necessarily the smallest product imaginable, though; it is simply the fastest way to start learning how to build a sustainable business with the minimum amount of effort."[^1]
