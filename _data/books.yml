- title: Dare To Lead
  subtitle: Brave Work. Tough Conversations. Whole Hearts
  author: Brene Brown
  notes: "Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the
  potential in people and ideas, and has the courage to develop that potential. When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right
  answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite
  when we share it with others. We don’t avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it’s necessary to
  do good work."

- title: Mindset
  subtitle: The New Psychology of Success
  author: Carol S. Dweck
  notes: "Stanford University psychologist Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset.
  In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be
  dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities
  are fixed—are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset
  reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment."
