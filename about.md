Software Architect with extensive experience in most areas of the Software Engineering cycle. My areas of concentration are in the design and development of distributed services using Java as well as .NET. Among the different roles and responsibilities I currently have, I enjoy using (and learning) new technologies that contribute to the success of an enterprise at scale.
