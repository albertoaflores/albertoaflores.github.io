excerpt: Topics and Queues are powerful components in a messaging infrastructure. There are times when you need to create a convention where producers always publish to topics and consumers always read from Queues while letting the message broker control the "message forwarding". This article describes how to configure such a setup with ActiveMQ.
---

Most recently, I had the need to create a bridge from Topics to Queues in order to create stateless services. The goal was to adopt a model where messages can be processed in parallel. Essentially, I wanted to configure the following (in the message broker):

![Sample of a Bridge from Topic to Queue](/assets/img/2019/Topic-Queue-Bridge.jpg#imageInPost "Topic to Queue Bridge")

While there are many other ways to do this, I wanted to experiment with ActiveMQ to support this setup. The following is how I configured it locally (in my dev box):

## Use a Docker Image
I used an ActiveMQ docker image found <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rmohr/activemq" target="_blank">here</a>. It was pretty straightforward and was able to get it running after a few commands. Here is what I did to define a baseline (this is from the instructions in the link above):

{% highlight shell %}

  docker run --user root --rm -ti \
             -v /Users/alberto/workspace/docker/activemq/conf:/mnt/conf \
             -v /Users/alberto/workspace/docker/activemq/data:/mnt/data \
             rmohr/activemq:5.15.4-alpine /bin/sh

{% endhighlight %}

Notice the following:
- I created the ```/conf``` and ```/data``` directory in my dev box.
- I mounted these folders into the ```/mnt/*``` respective to my local box.
- As the end of this command, a shell will be started inside the docker container

Then, I had to do the following (within the docker container):

{% highlight shell %}
  chown activemq:activemq /mnt/conf
  chown activemq:activemq /mnt/data
  cp -a /opt/activemq/conf/* /mnt/conf/
  cp -a /opt/activemq/data/* /mnt/data/
  exit
{% endhighlight %}

Now, I have the configuration in my ```conf``` folder.

## Configure ActiveMQ
Now that I have a mounted folder to the docker container (within the ```conf``` folder), I can edit the ```activemq.xml``` file so that the following is included in the ```virtualDestinations``` section:

{% highlight xml linenos %}
  <destinationInterceptors>
    <virtualDestinationInterceptor>
      <virtualDestinations>
        <compositeTopic name="t.example.service.event">
          <forwardTo>
            <queue physicalName="q.example.service.review" />
          </forwardTo>
        </compositeTopic>
      </virtualDestinations>
    </virtualDestinationInterceptor>
  </destinationInterceptors>
{% endhighlight %}

The important lines here are the section where the ```compositeTopic``` is configured to forward messages to the ```queue```. For a full example of the ```activemq.xml``` file, please find it <a href="https://gist.github.com/albertoaflores/40e6001df626f65aca561672cb3200fd">here</a>.


## Test: Send A Message Forward
You can now go to the admin console at:

<a href="http://localhost:8161/admin/send.jsp">http://localhost:8161/admin/send.jsp</a>

and send a message to the topic. You will see messages forwarded to the queues of your choice.
