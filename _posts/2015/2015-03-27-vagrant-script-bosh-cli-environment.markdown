I just published a Vagrant file (and configuration) for whoever wants to start picking up some ```BOSH``` CLI and/or CF CLI development. I'm experimenting with ```BOSH```, so I figure I'll share my config. This is found here:

I hope others find it useful.

Just do a ```vagrant up``` and you are good to go.
